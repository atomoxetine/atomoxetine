  <h3>🌟 About me</h3>
  Hii! My name is Emily and I'm a 19yo transgender girl from Brazil. I enjoy problem solving and I definitely have a thing for competitive programming, in which I was awarded a few prizes, so naturally I am very proficient at arriving at good solutions for intricate problems. I'm no goddess though, and I'm always willing to keep learning new things and I enjoy working with other people to achieve that goal :3
